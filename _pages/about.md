I am an associate research scientist in Computational Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the lab of [Wesley Tansey](https://wesleytansey.com/). My current interests are on problems arising in interactive learning, representation learning, and robust learning, particularly with applications to cancer research. 


Before MSKCC, I was a postdoc at Columbia University in the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), supervised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/). Before that, I received my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
