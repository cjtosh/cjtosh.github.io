I am an associate research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. My current interests are on problems arising in interactive learning, representation learning, and robust learning, particularly with applications to cancer research. Before MSKCC, I was a postdoc at Columbia University, supervised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/). Before that, I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was advised by [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
